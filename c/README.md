Wait for a sign from Gozer the Traveller.  He will come in one of the pre-chosen
forms.  During the rectification of the voldrani, the traveller came as
a large, moving Torg.  Then, during the third reconciliation of the last of the
Macketrik supplicants, they chose a new form for him:  that of a giant Slor!  Many
shuvs and xuls knew what it was to be roasted in the depths of the Slor that day I
can tell you.
