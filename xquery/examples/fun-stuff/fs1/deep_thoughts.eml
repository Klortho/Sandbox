I don't usually forward Internet crap, but I like Hanley's perspective.

*** Deep Thoughts by Jack Hanley ***

If you ever catch on fire, try to avoid seeing yourself in the
mirror, because I bet that's what REALLY throws you into a panic.

To me, it's a good idea to always carry two sacks of something when
you walk around. That way, if anybody says, "Hey, can you give me a
hand?" you can say, "Sorry, got these sacks."

One thing kids like is to be tricked. For instance, I was going to
take my nephew to Disneyland, but instead I drove him to an old
burned-out warehouse. "Oh no," I said, "Disneyland burned down." He
cried and cried, but I think that deep down he thought it was a
pretty good joke. I started to drive over to the real Disneyland,
but it was getting pretty late.

The face of a child can say it all, especially the mouth part of the
face.

If a kid asks where rain comes from, I think a cute thing to tell him
is, "God is crying." And if he asks why God is crying, another cute
thing to tell him is, "Probably because of something you did."

If you ever drop your keys into a river of molten lava, let 'em go,
because, man, they're gone.

I wish I would have a real tragic love affair and get so bummed out
that I'd just quit my job and become a bum for a few years, because
I was thinking about doing that anyway.

Maybe in order to understand mankind we have to look at that word
itself. MANKIND. Basically, it's made up of two separate words "mank"
and "ind." What do these words mean? It's a mystery, and that's why
so is mankind.

If you go flying back through time and you see somebody else flying
forward into the future, it's probably best to avoid eye contact.

It's easy to sit there and say you'd like to have more money. And I
guess that's what I like about it. It's easy. Just sitting there,
rocking back and forth, wanting that money.

To me, clowns aren't funny. In fact, they're kind of scary. I've
wondered where this started and I think it goes back to the time I
went to the circus and a clown killed my dad.

As the light changed from red to green to yellow and back to red
again, I sat there thinking about life. Was it nothing more than a
bunch of honking and yelling? Sometimes it seemed that way.

I can picture in my mind a world without war; a world without hate.
And I can  picture us attacking that world, because they'd never
expect it.

Instead of a trap door, what about a trap window? The guy looks out
it, and if he leans too far, he falls out. Wait, I guess that's like
a regular window.

When I found the skull in the woods, the first thing I did was call
the police. But then I got curious about it. I picked it up, and
started wondering who this person was, and why he had deer horns.

One thing vampire children have to be taught early on is "Don't run
with a wooden stake."

The tired and thirsty prospector threw himself down at the edge of
the watering hole and started to drink. But then he looked around and
saw skulls and bones everywhere. "Uh-oh," he thought. "This watering
hole is reserved for skeletons."
